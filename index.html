      <p id="extra">I am an Argentinian guy with a lot of goals, some more possible than others but most of them realistic. I have a lot of hobbies that I am passionate about, such as reading, diving, cars, pc gaming and tabletop games. I am currently on a path to achive my goals at all expenses, I want to finally live my life as I want and not what I was dealt, I want to cheat my hand in and not watch the dealer give me my cards. I am ready for the challenges this might bring for me and I will share this emotion with anyone willing to help me in this path. If that is something that inspires you, take a little of your time to contact me. Maybe something will come out of it.</p>
